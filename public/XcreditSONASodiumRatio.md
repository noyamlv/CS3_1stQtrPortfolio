3. **Write 2 paragraphs of reflection (each paragraph is ideally around 4 sentences)**
>> A clear picture of a government committed to 'real progress' was presented by SONA 2025. It prioritized infrastructure development, social services, and economic stability. To reassure the public that his administration is addressing their daily challenges, the President highlighted achievements like the growth of healthcare services and educational initiatives. He also discussed ongoing problems and proposals that still needed attention. This strategy focused on good governance and measurable results. It aimed to depict a progressive and effective "Bagong Pilipinas" committed to improving the standard of living for all its citizens.

>> However, a key aspect of this year's address was its quiet stance on politically sensitive issues. The choice to leave out topics like the impeachment case against the Vice President, the ICC investigation, and the West Philippine Sea dispute was a deliberate effort to steer clear of controversy. While this allowed the speech to concentrate on a unified national agenda, it also created a sense of separation between the administration's priorities and the larger, more complicated issues facing the country. This selective approach presents the President as a leader above political disputes, but it also means that an open and honest national discussion on these important issues was mostly postponed.


4. **What 1 word/ phrase/ or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025?**
* Let's just pray the government is actually cooking with this one...!
